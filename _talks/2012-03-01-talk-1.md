With the development of composite material technology and the advancement of aviation technology, folding wingtip technology has once again aroused great research interest in academia and industry due to its excellent performance, superior performance improvement capabilities and related technical potential. It can meet the design needs of manufacturing the next generation of large aspect ratio wings and further improve fuel efficiency.

Wing variants are an important development direction for future aircraft, but currently the structural forms have not been unified and the design principles are not yet clear. Through theoretical research and simulation analysis (using Patran and Nastran), the aeroelastic effects and changes of the hinged folding wing structure are explored, and the scientific principles are summarized.

Keywords: **folding wing, hinge, wing tip folding structure**
