The FSI problem is frequently related to boundary distortion and large deformation, so the conventional mesh-based method is uncapable of simulating it. Therefore, a particle-based method called Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method is introduced.

The main contribution of this thesis is to validate the feasibility of using the SPH module in LS-DYNA to simulate fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems in a way that successfully couples the SPH element and FEM element.

In this section, I have finished five numerical simulations, including: Poiseuille flow, dam break problem, water entry of the wedge, horizontal cylinder, and inclined cylinder.
