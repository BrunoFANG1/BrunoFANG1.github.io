The study is to segment infarcted brain tissue volumes for acute ischemic stroke using the non-contrast head CT scans at the early stage. For segmenting small lesions on CT images, exen most experienced expert doctors can only achieve a dice score of 0.2.

Treatment for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) depends on an early assessment of infarcted brain tissue volumes. Non-contrast CT (NCCT) of the brain is the standard of care for patients presenting with stroke symptoms. When the onset time is known and early, the infarcted tissue is assumed to be sufficiently small that the benefits of treatment outweigh the bleeding risks. However, when patients present with an unknown or delayed onset time, lesion CT density changes, and image exams may lead to a delay in treatment. To address this problem, our group developed a segmentation approach with deep learning method to segment the stroke lesion on early NCCT images to assist doctoral diagnosis and treatment decision.

My main contribution is to build generative model (e.g. GAN, diffusion model) to generate syn-MRIs to help segmentation model. This is research is still undergoing.
