My main contribution in this project is to provide theoretical analysis on regret bounds under different pertubation.

Reinforcement learning with perturbed action: If the imitation learning algorithm learns to replicate the epxert's policy under the state distribution induced by the expert, this leads to a regret bound that grows quadratically in the time horizon of the task. [1]
