With the popularity of ChatGPT, I read the paper which formulates the first version of ChatGPT and made a presentation in front of all students in AS.050.637 Reading the Mind: Computational Cognitive Neuroscience of Vision. However, I find it that few videos talks about this paper in Chinese Internet, so I decided to post it on Bilibili as a fun videos for both AI beginers and lovers.
