<div style="text-align: justify;" markdown="1">
I'm currently a master student majored in Computer Science at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu). Previously, I was an undergraduate student majored in Engineering Mechanics at the [DUT-BSU Joint Institute](https://dbji.dlut.edu.cn/English/About_Us/About_Us.htm), [Dalian University of Technology](https://en.dlut.edu.cn). My major focus before grad school was Computational Fluid Dynamics(CFD). After viewing the transformative potential of AI, I pivoted my focus on **robot learning, foundation model, reinforcement learning**. 

Specifically, research questions I'm interested in exploring are:
1. How can robots achieve higher intelligence by behavior cloning on human demonstrations?
2. How can robots reason and plan for diverse tasks? Is it possible to have a world model for decision-making or all tasks?
3. How to extract real world information or generate high-quality physically-realistic simulations for training AI agents?

My recent goal is to incorporate physic laws(e.g. Newton's Laws) into common generative models -> Generative model should model p(x, Physic) instead of p(x)
